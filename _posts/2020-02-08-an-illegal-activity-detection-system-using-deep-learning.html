This project is aimed at implementing a real-time illegal activity detection system to help reduce the problem of examination malpractice in examination halls. It seeks to make it effective and efficient for a minimum of one person to monitor feeds from surveillance cameras during examinations with the aid of computer vision. We stacked to only 3 activities that may occur during an exam. A dataset of 456 videos each between 3 to 6 seconds, divided into four classes including normal actions, exchanging of papers, use of foreign material (Mobile phone), looking on anotherâ€™s work.
Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) which are best at learning spatial and temporal features of an image was used. CNN provided us with two different hybrid architectures; Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) which are great at classifying global temporal clues. Two models were trained under each network to provide variations. Results obtained from the training showed that CNN + MLP models performed better in detecting illegal activities from our data with accuracies of 79% and 90% whiles CNN + LSTM models network had accuracies of 79% and 89%.
Accuracies recorded from the two-hybrid networks were encouraging, hence these models were used to build desktop application for real-time detection of illegal activities in the examination halls.
